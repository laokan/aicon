CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- This MUST be a LIVE-ACTION PHOTOGRAPH, not 3D render, not CGI, not animation
- Real human actors in real physical locations
- Captured with professional cinema cameras (ARRI, RED, Sony Venice)
- Natural lighting and practical effects only
- Photorealistic skin texture, fabric detail, environmental elements
- Film grain and depth of field characteristic of cinema photography

CINEMATOGRAPHY FOR VIDEO ANIMATION:
- Composition should support camera movement (medium shots, two-shots work well)
- Include depth layers for natural parallax when animated
- Avoid extreme angles that limit transition possibilities
- Frame with spatial context (not too tight) to allow camera adjustments
- Establishing shots should show clear spatial relationships

VISUAL CONTINUITY (Critical for seamless flow):
This shot CONTINUES from the previous shot. Maintain visual consistency:
- Previous shot description: {previous_shot_description}
- Keep consistent lighting, color palette, and atmosphere
- Ensure smooth visual transition from previous frame
- Characters should maintain consistent appearance and positioning
- Environment elements should show logical progression

SHOT DESCRIPTION:

Technical Specifications:
- Shot on 35mm film or high-end digital cinema camera
- Cinematic color grading (film look, not digital/game look)
- Professional cinematography with intentional composition
- Natural depth of field and bokeh
- Realistic lighting (practical lights, natural light, or professional film lighting)

Video-Ready Composition (This frame will be animated):
- Clear subject with good spatial positioning for camera movement
- Depth layers (foreground/midground/background) to enable parallax effects
- Composition that allows for natural camera transitions (push in, pull back, pan)
- Action potential: subject positioned to suggest movement or interaction
- Avoid extreme close-ups that limit animation possibilities
- Frame with breathing room for camera adjustments

ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
- NO 3D rendering artifacts
- NO CGI character models
- NO video game aesthetics
- NO anime or cartoon styles
- NO artificial/synthetic looking imagery
- NO obvious digital manipulation

Remember: This is a REAL PHOTOGRAPH from a LIVE-ACTION FILM, not a digital creation.
